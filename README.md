College-System
Introduction
The College-System project is a comprehensive management system designed to streamline and automate various administrative tasks in a college environment. The system helps manage student registrations, course allocations, grade tracking, and timetable management, making it easier for students and faculty to interact. It aims to enhance the efficiency of college operations through an intuitive interface and reliable database integration.

Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building scalable server-side applications.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for setting up routing and middleware management.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user and course data.
Bootstrap: A responsive CSS framework for designing the user interface.
JavaScript: Client-side scripting language used to handle dynamic content.
Functionalities
1. User Registration
HTML Page: signup.html
Description: Allows students and faculty to create a new account by entering necessary details.
Validation: Ensures that all fields are filled out and passwords are secure.
2. User Login
HTML Page: login.html
Description: Enables users to log in using their registered credentials.
Validation: Checks that the entered email and password match an existing account.
3. Course Registration
HTML Page: courses.html
Description: Students can register for courses and view available course offerings.
Functionality: Displays a list of courses, and allows students to select and enroll.
4. Grade Tracking
HTML Page: grades.html
Description: Students can view their grades for completed courses.
Functionality: Displays grades stored in the system and allows faculty to update them.
Project Breakdown
File Structure
app.js: Main application file for server setup and routing.
public/: Contains static files including HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript.
index.html: Home page of the system.
signup.html: User registration page.
login.html: Login page for students and faculty.
courses.html: Course registration page.
grades.html: Grade tracking page.
style.css: Custom styles for the system.
script.js: Client-side JavaScript for dynamic content.
Scripts Overview
script.js: Handles DOM interactions, course registration, and grade display.
login.js: Manages login functionality and form validation.
signup.js: Manages user registration functionality and form validation.
Styles Overview
style.css: Provides the visual design for the pages, including layout and button styles.
formstyle.css: Contains form-specific styles such as input field validation (e.g., highlighting fields in red or green).
Validation
Registration Validation: Checks for empty fields, valid email formats, and secure passwords.
Login Validation: Confirms user credentials against the database.
How the Project Works
The backend of the College-System is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB serving as the database for storing user and course information.
The system's main functionality includes user authentication, course registration, and grade management.
On registration, user data is securely stored in MongoDB, and passwords are hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security.
Conclusion
The College-System project is a robust application designed to simplify and streamline the administrative tasks at a college. Its clean interface, secure user authentication, and efficient database management ensure a smooth experience for both students and faculty. The project is scalable and can be further enhanced by adding features like attendance tracking, notifications, or advanced search functionality.
